What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

I had to figure out how to work with different data structures and which is best to use. When doing projects we had to create a program that sorts course information from a csv file, organize, and print sorted list. 

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

I approached the problem by first figureing out the differnt data structures and the benifts to using each one. After figuring out which one works best for the project I created a psuedocode chart to break down how the program would work. 

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

I encountered A LOT of problems along the way. One of which was the virtual lab not working and not being able to get a working IDE on my macbook. I ended up installing a bootcamp bootle image of windows on my macbook and then was able to continue. I wish I would have know about this before week 6. Another thing I found that worked was to stop and take a break to reevaluate what I was trying to solve. 

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

My work on this project expanded my approach to designing software and developing programs by opening my eyes to the fact that just because I know one way to implement something that might not be the best way to implement it. There are many ways to get the same result in coding and its my job to be knowledgable of different ways to do it to make a better program fro the end user. 

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I have now started commenting my code in small blocks rather than line by line. I have also started to think about my code as if other people are reading it and not just me. I now see how important it is to make your code readable and easy to maintain.
